# chserver
Changes the host and server base path from a cms sql backup script.

When you are porting a site to another server and when it will catch a new url, something very common when porting a site from development machine to production and vice-versa, changing both the server path and url in the sql script will be the basic step.
In a simple site, or even a simple Drupal or WordPress installation this is enough. But somewhat more complex installations further steps will be required.
